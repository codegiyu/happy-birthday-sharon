    "Happy 15th birthday to you. I wish you joy, the best of health, success in your upcoming exams, continued harmony with your family, \
    a wealth of good friends, and all around I wish you all the good things life has to offer. Have a blessed rest of your day.",

    "I miss you very much, you know. A lot of times when I close my eyes and daydream about the things I want to achieve in the near future, \
    I think of making good money and having my own apartment and hosting you guys for a few weeks of holiday. It'd be so much fun. \
    Lot's of hugs and anime. Well, me and you would be cool with those but we'd probably have to throw in some k-dramas in there for Iya and Chi.",

    "Hmm, 15 already. You mentioned you wished that number was a little bigger. I can't say I don't understand the feeling sha, \
    but I can tell you you definitely don't need to worry about any of that. You are beautiful, smart, caring, fun, like anime...\
    yes, that's a good thingüòâ, amazing sister and friend.", 
    
    "And what's more, you're going to get even more of those things. So don't wish you were older, \
    because that would mean you'd have less potential for growth. I'm happy you're young and this amazing and I can't wait to see how you'll be \
    in 10 years time.",

    "About that maths you're worried about, making this small website kinda made me think we can probably work out some kind of web app we could \
    come up with to help you with maths. But as you don't have a phone, that adds some complexity to things, I guess. Well we'll talk more on it later.",

    "I've been talking (writing) a lot, and like all good things, this note too has to come to an end. Happy birthday once again my lovely Tabi. \
    Remain blessed....oh, say hi to Destiny, Iya, Chi, Onyii, Peace and your mum for me.",

    "Love,",
